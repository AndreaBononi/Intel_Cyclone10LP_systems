During the fitting, each DUT pin is assigned to a real IO pin of the FPGA.
In some cases it may be useful to perfor a timing analysis on a subsystem.
In this case, even if the pin assignment is not defined, Quartus automatically make the assignment.
The number of pins of the subsystem might be greater than the number of available IO pins.
IN this case, it is necessary to mark the pins as "virtual pins".
On Quartus, open the Assignment Editor, double click under the "To" column and select the pins to be virtualized (DO NOT VIRTUALIZE THE CLOCK PINS).
Under the "Assignment Name" column select "virtual pin".
Under the "Value" column select "on".
Save and run the compliation.
