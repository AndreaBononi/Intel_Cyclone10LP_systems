DIRECTORIES DESCRIPTION:
	#
	# ./AvalonMM_to_SSRAM_v1/
		-- First version of the AvalonMM to SSRAM converter
		-- It is able to append different operations
		-- It is NOT able to initialize the hRAM configuration registers
		-- It is NOT able to read/write the hRAM configuration registers
		-- It is NOT able to manage burst operations
		-- Functional RTL-level simulation: succesfully completed
		-- Functional gate-level simulation: not performed
		-- Timing simulation: not performed
		-- OBSOLETE
	#
	# ./AvalonMM_to_SSRAM_v2/
		-- Second version of the AvalonMM to SSRAM converter
		-- It is able to append different operations
		-- It is able to initialize the hRAM configuration registers
		-- It defines a private configuration register to read and write
		-- It is NOT able to manage burst operations
		-- Functional RTL-level simulation: succesfully completed
		-- Functional gate-level simulation: not performed
		-- Timing simulation: not performed
		-- Currently under development
